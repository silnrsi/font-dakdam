25.3.2019
Changed name 'Khmer Dakdam1' to 'Khmer Dakdam YY'. (YY is the Unicode name for 17ba). The YY has an unusually large distance between the two tails of the glyph. This was done on request of the Kuy translator for easier visual distinction of this glyph from 17b8 & 17b9.
Created 'Khmer Dakdam YY' in r,i,b,bi.

italics regular and regular:
created the correct forms of uni179517B6 and uni179517C5.right in all three font files. But the new fonts have not yet been compiled and distributed.
